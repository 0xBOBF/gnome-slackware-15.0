Geoclue is a D-Bus service that provides location information.

The primary goal of the Geoclue project is to make creating
location-aware applications as simple as possible, while the secondary
goal is to ensure that no application can access location information
without explicit permission from user.

geoclue2 is a rewrite of the original geoclue. You can safely install
both geoclue and geoclue2 at the same time.

avahi is an optional dependency, used for location sharing (by redshift,
for example).  To enable it, use the option AVAHI=yes

  AVAHI=yes ./geoclue2.Slackbuild

To build HTML Geoclue GTK docs, use the option GTK_DOC=yes

  GTK_DOC=yes ./geoclue2.Slackbuild
