# GNOME for Slackware 15.0 - libsoup3 port

This branch is a "work in progress". It is an attempt to patch and/or upgrade parts of gnome-41 on slackbuilds.org so that it depends on libsoup3.

See the TODO file for slackbuilds that are not yet working, and other work needed to be done.

Note that the queue files need adjustment still, since some deps have changed with slackbuild upgrades.
