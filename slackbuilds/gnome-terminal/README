GNOME Terminal is a terminal emulation application that you can use to
perform the following actions:

Access a UNIX shell in the GNOME environment.

Run any application that is designed to run on VT102, VT220, and xterm
terminals.

GNOME Terminal accepts all of the escape sequences that the VT102 and
VT220 terminals use for functions such as positioning the cursor and 
clearing the screen.
