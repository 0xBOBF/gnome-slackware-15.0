GNOME Screenshot is a small utility that takes a screenshot of the 
whole desktop; the currently focused window; or an area of the screen.

Note: The gnome shell can already do all these screenshot functions 
without this package, using keyboard shortcuts with the PrintScreen 
button. This application provides an alternative gui for taking
screenshots.
