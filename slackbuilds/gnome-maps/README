Maps gives you quick access to maps all across the world. We use the
collaborative OpenStreetMap database, enabling our users to make 
smaller changes to places and points-of-interests.

Note on Dependencies:
gnome-maps will fail to build if its GNOME dependencies are not built
with introspection and vala bindings. These options have been disabled
by default by the maintainer of these builds on slackbuilds.org, so you
will need to ensure you set the following variables when building all 
the deps of gnome-maps:

INTROSPECTION=yes
VALA=yes
VAPI=yes
