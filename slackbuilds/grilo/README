Grilo is a framework for browsing and searching media content from 
various sources using a single API.

Note: This SlackBuild defaults to building with 'soup2' to keep 
compatibility with other GNOME software on slackbuilds.org that depend
on soup2 still. If you would like to build against libsoup3 then you 
will have to install the dependency and pass the build the following 
environment variable to allow building against libsoup3:

 SOUP3=true
