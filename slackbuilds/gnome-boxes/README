A simple GNOME 3 application to access virtual machines.

NOTE:
gnome-boxes is only a graphical front end for virtual machines. The
backend used is 'qemu', which can also be installed from 
slackbuilds.org. 'qemu' must be built with smartcard passthrough 
(libcacard), and usb redirection (usbredir) enabled.
