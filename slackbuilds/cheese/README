Cheese is a program for the GNOME Desktop which allows you to take 
photos, videos, and anything else you can think of with your webcam.

NOTE: The clutter-gtk/clutter/cogl dependencies need to be built with 
introspection enabled. These slackbuilds have introspection disabled 
and require you to set the following environment variable at build time
to re-enable building their introspection files:

INTROSPECTION=yes

If you see build errors about missing clutter-gtk/clutter/cogl '.gir'
files, then these dependencies were not built with introspection 
enabled.

Optional Dependencies:
- gnome-video-effects (for camera/video effects at runtime)
