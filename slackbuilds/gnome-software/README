GNOME Software allows users to easily find, discover and install apps.
It also keeps their OS, apps and devices up to date without them having
to think about it, and gives them confidence that their system is up to 
date. It supports popular distributions, subject to those distributions 
maintaining their own distro-specific integration code.
