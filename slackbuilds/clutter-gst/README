Clutter-Gst is an integration library for using GStreamer with Clutter.
It provides a GStreamer sink to upload frames to GL and an actor that
implements the ClutterGstPlayer interface using playbin.

NOTE: The clutter and cogl dependencies need to be built with 
introspection enabled. These slackbuilds have introspection disabled
and require you to set the following environment variable at build time
to re-enable building their introspection files:

INTROSPECTION=yes

If you see build errors about missing clutter and/or cogl '.gir' files,
then these dependencies were not built with introspection enabled.
