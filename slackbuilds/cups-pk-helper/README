cups-pk-helper is a PolicyKit helper to configure cups with 
fine-grained privileges.

For example, it's possible to let users enable/disable printers without
requiring a password, while still requiring a password for editing 
printer settings.

To make it easy to integrate cups-pk-helper in system-config-printer, 
the D-Bus API is based to a large extent on the pycups one.
