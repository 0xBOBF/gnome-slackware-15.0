Folks is a contact aggregation library. It retrieves contacts from 
various sources (including Telepathy IM accounts, and local contact
stores) and compiles them into fully-fledged people objects.

Important Note:
The 'evolution-data-server' dependency and its related dependencies
have generation of introspection and vala/vapi files disabled and must
be switched on with the following environment variables:

INTROSPECTION=yes
VALA=yes
VAPI=yes

Folks will fail to build without introspection and vala/vapi support 
enabled in these dependencies.
