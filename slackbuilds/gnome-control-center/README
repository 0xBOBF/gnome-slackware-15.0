GNOME Settings is GNOME's main interface for configuration of various
aspects of your desktop.

Optional Dependencies:
- gnome-color-manager
- cheese

The SlackBuild script has 'cheese' disabled by default to keep this 
dependency optional. If you have 'cheese' installed, you can enable
building gnome-control-center with 'cheese' by setting:

CHEESE=true
