GNOME Color Manager is a session framework that makes it easy to 
manage, install and generate color profiles in the GNOME desktop.

This project has the following features:

- Setting output gamma tables (with local brightness and adjustments) 
  to any Xrandr output (falling back to the per-screen methods for 
  drivers that do not yet support Xrandr 1.3).

- Setting of settings at session start, and when monitors are 
  hotplugged.

- Easy install of vendor supplied ICC or ICM files, just by double 
  clicking on the file.

- Easy display calibration using an external calibration device, and 
  scanner calibration using a inexpensive IT 8.7 target. For 
  calibration, the ArgyllCMS package is required.

- Integration X11 by setting the per-screen and per-output _ICC_PROFILE
  atom, which makes applications such as the GIMP use a color managed 
  output.

- Easy to use DBus interface for applications to query what ICC 
  profiles should be used for a specific device or device type. This is
  session activated and is only started when it is needed, and quits 
  after a small period of idleness.
