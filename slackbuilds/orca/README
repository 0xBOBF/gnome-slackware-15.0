Orca is a free, open source, flexible, and extensible screen reader
that provides access to the graphical desktop via user-customizable
combinations of speech and/or braille.

Orca works with applications and toolkits that support the assistive
technology service provider interface (AT-SPI), which is the primary
assistive technology infrastructure for the Solaris and Linux
operating environments.  Applications and toolkits supporting the
AT-SPI include the GNOME GTK+ toolkit, the Java platform's Swing
toolkit, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, Gecko, and WebKitGtk.  AT-SPI support
for the KDE Qt toolkit is currently being pursued.

user community, and where to log bugs and feature requests.
