This is a meta package that pulls in all the dependencies to build
GNOME Desktop 41.9. This includes the desktop environment, as well as
a number of gnome applications that integrate nicely with the desktop.

The SlackBuild only installs the slack-desc meta data. The rest of the
software is  pulled in by the .info file REQUIRES information.

Note: 'colord' is included as a dep and requires a group and user for 
the build to complete properly. Please add the colord group and users
with the following, *before* starting the build:

 groupadd -g 303 colord
 useradd -d /var/lib/colord -u 303 -g colord -s /bin/false colord
