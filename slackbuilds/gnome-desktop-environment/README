This is a meta package that pulls in all the dependencies to build
GNOME Desktop 41.9. This includes the desktop environment, as well as
a number of gnome applications that integrate nicely with the desktop.

The SlackBuild only installs the slack-desc meta data. The rest of the
software is pulled in by the .info file REQUIRES information.

Important note: 'colord' is included as a dependency and requires a 
colord group and user for the build to complete properly. Please add
the colord group and user before starting the build, otherwise the 
entire queue will fail to build once it reaches the colord step. The
following code will add the colord group and user:

 groupadd -g 303 colord
 useradd -d /var/lib/colord -u 303 -g colord -s /bin/false colord
