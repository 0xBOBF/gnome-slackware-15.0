This is the project of the Files app, a file browser for GNOME,
internally known by its historical name nautilus.

Dependencies:
- gnome-autoar
- gnome-desktop
- libhandy
- libportal
- tracker

* Documentation on Nautilus recommends building tracker against
  tracker-miners which is currently not in the slackbuilds.org repo. 
  However, nautilus still builds and functions without a 
  tracker-miners package on the system.
