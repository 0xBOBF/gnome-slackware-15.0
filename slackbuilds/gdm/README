GDM is a system service that is responsible for providing graphical
logins and managing local and remote display.

Note that Slackware comes with the 'gdm' group and user already 
configured.

Required Dependencies:
- gnome-session
- gnome-shell

Note that 'gdm' will build without 'gnome-session' and 'gnome-shell'
installed, but 'gdm' will be unusable without them.

A note on PAM:
GDM can build PAM configs for linux distros like redhat, lfs, and arch.
However, none of these configs are suitable for Slackware's PAM 
configuration. Therefore this SlackBuild provides custom PAM configs 
for GDM that function properly with Slackware. I didn't include 
'gdm-fingerprint' or 'gdm-smartcard', since I don't have the hardware 
needed to properly test functionality.
