The 'gnome-core' package is essentially an empty package that depends
on *all* the packages that are part of the gnome-core distribution, 
AND are available on slackbuilds.org. Building the gnome-core package
and all its dependencies will install all the core components of a 
GNOME Desktop release, e.g "GNOME Desktop 41.9".

Important Note: 'colord' and 'avahi' are included as dependencies
and require 'colord' and 'avahi' groups and users for the build to
complete properly. Please add the colord and avahi groups and users
before starting the build, otherwise the entire queue will fail to
build once it reaches the respective colord or avahi builds.

The following code will add the colord and avahi group and user:
 
  groupadd -g 303 colord
  useradd -d /var/lib/colord -u 303 -g colord -s /bin/false colord
 
  groupadd -g 214 avahi
  useradd -u 214 -g 214 -c "Avahi User" -d /dev/null -s /bin/false avahi

Also note that to properly use Avahi, you will need to start/stop its
daemons in /etc/rc.d. See the Avahi READMEs for details.

Booting to runlevel 4 will start the GNOME Display Manager, GDM, by
default. This is the recommended way to use GNOME, so that GDM can 
handle screen locking. Xinit scripts are provided as well, so that
GNOME can be started from runlevel 3.

This package also provides a list of all installed packages in the
file: /usr/doc/gnome-core-$VERSION/gnome-core.list. This list is useful
for finding and removing packages installed by the gnome-core meta
package dependencies. See the gnome-core.list file for details.

There are several omissions from the official gnome-core release, 
compared to what is included in the gnome-core "meta package":

 * gnome-software - A flatpak GUI front-end combined with a package
                    manager. Not uploaded due to non-functional 
                    package manager features.

 * gnome-initial-setup - Does sysadmin tasks via a gui on first boot.
                         Leaving this out due to existing methods to
                         doing these tasks.

 * gnome-logs - A journald viewer, which has no use on stock Slackware.

 * epiphany - There is a build available on slackbuilds.org, but it is
              built against webkit2gtk-4.1 & libsoup3, while the rest
              of the gnome-core 41 distribution is built against the
              older webkit2gtk-4.0 & libsoup2 libraries. If you want to
              install epiphany then install webkit2gtk-4.1 and epiphany
              after completing the gnome-core build.
