The 'gnome-core' package is essentially an empty package that depends
on *all* the packages that are part of the gnome-core distribution, 
AND are available on slackbuilds.org. Building the gnome-core package
and all its dependencies will install all the core components of a 
GNOME Desktop release, e.g "GNOME Desktop 41.9".

Important Note: 'colord' and 'avahi' are included as a dependencies 
and require a colord and avahi group and user for the build to 
complete properly. Please add the colord and avahi group and user before
starting the build, otherwise the entire queue will fail to build once 
it reaches the respective colord or avahi builds.

The following code will add the colord and avahi group and user:

 groupadd -g 303 colord
 useradd -d /var/lib/colord -u 303 -g colord -s /bin/false colord

 groupadd -g 214 avahi
 useradd -u 214 -g 214 -c "Avahi User" -d /dev/null -s /bin/false avahi

Also note that to properly use Avahi, you will need to start/stop its
daemons in /etc/rc.d. See the Avahi readmes for details.

Booting to runlevel 4 will start the GNOME Display Manager, GDM, by
default. This is the recommended way to use GNOME, so that GDM can 
handle screen locking. Xinit scripts are provided as well, so that
GNOME can be started from runlevel 3.

This package also provides a list of all installed packages in the
file: /usr/doc/gnome-core-$VERSION/gnome-core.list. This list is useful
for finding and removing packages installed by the gnome-core meta
package dependencies. See the gnome-core.list file for details.

There are several omissions from the official gnome-core release, 
compared to what is included in the gnome-core "meta package":

 * gnome-logs - This is a system log viewer for the systemd journal,
                and so is useless on a Slackware system.

 * gnome-software - A flatpak GUI front-end. Adds a number of 
                    dependencies and hasn't been uploaded to SBo.

                    Doubles as a software updater via PackageKit, but
                    the slackware implementation is broken, leaving 
                    much of the UI non-functional.

 * gnome-initial-setup - This is intended to be used on initial boot of
                         a fresh installation, and does things like
                         create new users and other system setup tasks.

                         These things are normally done via Slackware's
                         installer and adduser scripts, so do not use.

 * epiphany - There is a build available on slackbuilds.org, but it is
              built against webkit2gtk-4.1 & libsoup3, while the rest
              of the gnome-core 41 distribution is built against the
              older webkit2gtk-4.0 & libsoup2 libraries. The two can't
              be mixed and will cause crashes.
