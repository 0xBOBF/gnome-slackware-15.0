This is a meta package that can be used to resolve all the dependencies
 of GNOME's core distribution from slackbuilds.org. This is close to 
all of the core release. See the README.SBo file for details.

This package also installs an uninstall helper script.

Important note: 'colord' is included as a dependency and requires a 
colord group and user for the build to complete properly. Please add
the colord group and user before starting the build, otherwise the 
entire queue will fail to build once it reaches the colord step. The
following code will add the colord group and user:

 groupadd -g 303 colord
 useradd -d /var/lib/colord -u 303 -g colord -s /bin/false colord
