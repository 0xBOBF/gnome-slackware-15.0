Blocaled provides a stand-alone implementation of the localed D-Bus
service. This is useful for things like gnome applications that utilize
the localed service.

blocaled is maintained by BLFS editor Pierre Labastie, for the specific
needs of the BLFS project, but may be used on any system implementing
the libgio library.
