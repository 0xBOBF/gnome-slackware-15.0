GNOME Shell provides core user interface functions for the GNOME 
desktop, like switching to windows and launching applications. GNOME
Shell takes advantage of the capabilities of modern graphics hardware
and introduces innovative user interface concepts to provide a visually
attractive and easy to use experience.

Note: This build of gnome-shell includes it own gschema files from 
gsettings-desktop-schemas-41.0, which allows gnome-shell-41 to run on 
Slackware 15.0. These schema files are kept separate from Slackware's 
copy, which are at version 40.0. gnome-shell is made aware of these 
custom built schemas using a wrapper script.
